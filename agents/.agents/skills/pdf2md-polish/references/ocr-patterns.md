# Common OCR Patterns

This document catalogs recurring OCR/PDF extraction artifacts that `polish.py` handles automatically, plus patterns that require LLM judgment in the semantic review step.

## Handled by Script (Deterministic)

### Ligature Replacement

| OCR Glyph | Replacement | Unicode |
|---|---|---|
| ﬁ | fi | U+FB01 |
| ﬂ | fl | U+FB02 |
| ﬃ | ffi | U+FB03 |
| ﬄ | ffl | U+FB04 |
| ﬅ | st | U+FB05 |
| ﬆ | st | U+FB06 |

**Rule**: Always applied. One-way transformation. If original intentionally uses Unicode ligatures (extremely rare), they will be destroyed.

### Inline Whitespace Collapse

Runs of spaces/tabs in prose and headings → single space. Protected zones: inline code, inline math, link/image targets.

### Soft Line Break Reflow

PDF/OCR physical line wraps inside prose paragraphs are rejoined before sentence splitting.

```
# Input (OCR physical lines):
The first objective is to design a high-performance
classifier, which runs in real-time on
embedded platforms.

# Output (reflowed):
The first objective is to design a high-performance classifier, which runs in real-time on embedded platforms.
```

### Math Delimiter Normalization

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `\(...\)` inline | `$...$` |
| `\[...\]` display | `$$...$$` |
| `\begin{...}` environments | **Untouched** (would lose alignment/numbering) |

### Inline Math Spacing Normalization

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `$x _ { i } + y _ { j }$` | `$x_{i}+y_{j}$` |
| `$\mathrm{r e c t}(t)$` | `$\mathrm{rect}(t)$` |
| `$a + b$` | `$a+b$` |

**Rule**: Interior whitespace of math formulas is rewritten for compactness. This is NOT byte-preserving.

### OCR Number Spaces

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `3 . 14` | `3.14` |

**Note**: The script attempts to merge these, but complex cases may be missed. Check output.

## Requires LLM Judgment (Semantic Review)

### Images Splitting Sentences

OCR sometimes places images/figure captions mid-sentence.

```
# Input (broken by image):
The key components for RFMI-measurement are the

![image](fig1.jpg)

Fig. 1 Scheme of a PMD-array.

2D-mixer and the 2D-detector.

# Expected output (image moved after sentence):
The key components for RFMI-measurement are the 2D-mixer and the 2D-detector.

![image](fig1.jpg)

```

**Detection**: If the line before an image does NOT end with `.`, `!`, or `?`, the sentence is likely split.

### Punctuation Inside Math

OCR may place commas/periods inside math delimiters.

```
# Input (comma inside math):
$\\varphi, $

# Expected output (comma outside):
$\\varphi$,
```

**Detection**: Punctuation followed by a space before closing `$`.

### en-dash Degraded to Hyphen

OCR/PDF extraction frequently converts en-dashes (`–`, U+2013) to hyphens (`-`).

**Promote to en-dash when unambiguously a numeric range**:
- Page ranges: `pp. 12-15` → `pp. 12–15`
- Year spans: `2010-2020` → `2010–2020`
- Figure/table ranges: `Figs. 3-5` → `Figs. 3–5`

**Leave as hyphen when in doubt**:
- Identifiers: `COVID-19`, `RTX-4090`
- Hierarchical labels: `Section 3-2`
- Compound words: `state-of-the-art`
- Phone/ISBN/serial numbers

**A wrong promotion is worse than a missed one.**

### OCR Character Confusion

| Pattern | Example | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `0` vs `O` | `Fig. 0` → `Fig. O` or `10`? | Context-dependent |
| `1` vs `l` | `lntroduction` → `Introduction` | Usually `I` |
| `rn` vs `m` | `rnodify` → `modify` | Common in low-res scans |
| `a the` (double article) | `overview of a the PMD-chip` | Remove the stray article |

### Unbalanced `$$` Delimiters

If `$$` don't pair up, the script preserves the block unchanged and prints `[WARNING]` to stderr. The LLM should check stderr and decide whether to fix or leave it.

## Patterns NOT Handled (Intentional)

| Pattern | Why skipped |
|---|---|
| Hyphen → en-dash promotion | Too many legitimate hyphens; LLM judgment required |
| `\begin{align}` → `$$` | Would lose multi-line alignment and equation numbering |
| Ligature → ASCII in intentional Unicode | Extremely rare; false positives worse than misses |
